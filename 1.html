<h2>What is Training? </h2>
<p>Excercise is definetly the best way to <strong>build your <u>muscle</u></strong> in your body. 
Resting and supplying your body with right nutrition is also important but it'll be almost for nothing if you do not excercise 
for them to be of a good use. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=goku&tbm=isch&chips=q:goku,g_1:super+saiyan:LG_friC9b9k%3D&rlz=1C1YTUH_enUS1027US1027&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwil84yZs8eDAxVayMkDHS1VB_kQ4lYoAXoECAEQNg&biw=1519&bih=695"target="_blank"title="goku pics">
Training</a> is always the base before the other two procedures come to their place. 
No matter how right you eat, no matter how good quality rest you get, it wouldn't be very effective
without the proper training.</p>

<p>There are a lot of areas of excercise and different intensity of excercise. 
It all depends on your body parts and your recovery speed and your genetic.</p>
