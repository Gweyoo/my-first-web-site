<h2>Why rest? </h2>
<p>Some say "you never rest when you want to succed". well not for the bodybuilding, your muscle actually grows when you rest!<br>
 you give your muscle proper destruction and nutrition but then it'll need some time to heal as well to be bigger and stronger.<br>
some people think you wokrout every day of the week or to reach certain amount of hours every single session would always work. <br>
<strong>Nope!</strong> once you get enough stress into your body and fed em, you must give it a good quality rest. <br>
lot of people underestimate how important resting is it is as much as important as training and eating. </p>

It all depends on your body parts and your recovery speed and your genetic.</p>
