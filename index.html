<h2>What is Bodybuilding? </h2>
<p>Bodybuilding is simply the process of building your body in your own ways. To build big and strong muscle, cut off the bodyfat, and improve
rather smaller muscles to balance it out the symmetry. This process can last forever or for a few months depends on your goal. If you want just a 
"beach body" for a short season, it could take less than 6 months, if you want have strong but also very thin on a body fat, it could take more than years. <br>
I consider bodybuilding as some form of art. Like how sculptors would cut off the big chunk of rock, you'd cut off your body fat as much as it needs to be burnt,
You'll put on the muscle as artist put more clay on their statue to make what they desire. <br>There's no complete right or wrong in the bodybuilding (most of the time) 
but there's some ways that can possitively benefit you to get to your goal most likely much faster! It's the right technique on your training, 
setting up suitable nutrition goal for yourself and providing a right amount of rest for your body. This website will guide you through the tips and 
essential knowledge that'll be very helpful to reach your goals in your bodybuilding lifestyle!</p>
